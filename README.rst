Lecture Notes on Plasma Theory and Diagnostics
==============================================

A repository of my notes based around the Plasma Theory and Diagnostics
(PTD) course taught at the University of Glasgow. These notes may be
(and probably are) riddled with mistakes, so use at your own risk!

The LaTeX files contained in this repository have a number of
dependencies, which I shall list in due course.
